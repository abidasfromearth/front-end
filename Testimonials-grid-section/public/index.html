      <h2 class="grid-card__title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
        more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
      <p class="grid-card__description">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
        make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
        course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
        grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
        Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <h2 class="grid-card__title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <p class="grid-card__description">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
        former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
        in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
        In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

      <p class="grid-card__description">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as
        a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
        incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
